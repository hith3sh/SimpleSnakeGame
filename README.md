# SimpleSnakeGame
This is a simple Snake game created using Java ,just did it for fun and to learn about java .
Hoping to add a game restart button , so that with a user click he/she can play the snake game using the same java window without having to open a another window.
Also hoping to make changes when the snake hits a corner of the wall ,some color change or something which would indicate the effect of hitting a wall.
tht's it for now :)
